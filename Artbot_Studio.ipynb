        "1.   Go to the 'Runtime' menu, and select 'Change runtime type'. Make sure the accelerator is set to 'GPU'\n",

        "2.   Run the init cell below by pressing the play button. You'll only have to run this once per session, even after you restart the runtime. It'll take a little while, it has to download at least 2GB of data to Google's servers, but the connection is really fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   Restart the runtime before running the next cell to get the studio link. Do this through the 'Runtime' menu, or by pressing ctrl-m then the period key. You'll probably have to run this cell twice before getting a URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Make sure you have a URL before running the next cell - it won't exit so the URL needs to be generated first. If you run it without a URL just stop it and run the URL generator until you get one.\n",

        "5.   Run the final cell, then go to the URL. There may be some output here, but the settings interface and image previews are in the other tab.\n",
