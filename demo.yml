# A document can have any number of runs
# Reference run outputs with '*name'. This can be used in image prompts and init images
# Runs don't have to be in order in the document, but if they are it'll go slightly faster
# Only the prompt is required. When a value is left out the last known one is used
# You can stop the last value from being used by passing False for it
# So set all your values like size and iteration for the runs in the first one and they'll stick
