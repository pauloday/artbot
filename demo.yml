# A document can have any number of runs
# Reference run outputs with '*name'. This can be used in image prompts and init images
# Runs don't have to be in order in the document, but if they are it'll go slightly faster
# Only the prompt is required. When a value is left out the last known one is used
# You can stop the last value from being used by passing False for it
# So set all your values like size and iteration for the runs in the first one and they'll stick

# Prompt Strings:
# The prompt and image_prompt can be chained with special characters:
# a&&b: Run a and b at the same time
# a--b: Run a, then swap it out for b
# a++b: Run a, then run both
# a||b: Run a, then clear all prompts and run b (same as '--' for pairs)
# Each of these will run a and b for equal iterations, but this can be adjusted with '__':
# a++b__2||c__3: Run a, b, and c at a 1:2:3 ratio

  prompts:
    - 'fire lava--mountain water--ocean waves'

# Try addingg James Gurney style a couple ways
init_image: # use base as init image
  prompts:
    - 'by James Gurney'
  init_image: '*base'
  iterations: 50 # init images are overwritten quickly
image_prompt: # use base as prompt

  image_prompts:
    - '*base'
second_pass: # smooth it out a bit maybe
  prompts:
    - 'lava++mountain--ocean waves'

final_blend: # try mixing them all
  prompt: 'By James Gurney'
  # you could also put these one per line, this is just more compact
