# A document can have any number of runs
# Runs can use the output from prior runs as inputs for prompts and init images
# Reference image outputs with '*name'
# They don't have to be in order in the document, but it'll make things faster
# Only the prompt is required. When a value is left out the last known one is used
# So set all your values for the runs in the first one and they'll stick
# See parse.py for allowed values and defaults

# Prompt Strings:
# The prompt and image_prompt have some special characters:
# || - Run prompts concurrently on the same image
# -- - Run prompts sequentially on the same image
# Sequential has a optional ratio of time spent per prompt
# Pass it to each prompt with a __: 'one--two__2'
# This would do 'one' and 'two' at a 1:2 ratio
